# neovim-config
This repository contains the `init.lua` file for my neovim configuration. My current setup involves using the AstroVim distribution & Warp terminal for development.

If you want to use this configuration, first install AstroVim as your Neovim distribution, then replace the `init.lua` here with the existing `init.lua` found in the config directory.
