# neovim-config

This repository contains the `init.lua` files for my neovim configurations.

Originally I was using [AstroVim distribution](https://astronvim.com/) as my base configuration, with some modifications on top. You can find these in the astronvim-init.lua file.

Recently I've been using [Lunarnvim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) to try something new, and I'm liking it a lot. Thanks to the nature of Lunarnvim's installation process, I can actually use both Astronvim and Lunarvim at the same time. To open in Astronvim, I use the `nvim` command from my Temrinal. For Lunarnvim, I use `lvim`.

On top of this, currently I use the [Warp terminal](https://www.warp.dev/) for development.

If you want to use this configuration, first install AstroVim or Lunarvim as your Neovim distribution, then replace the respective `init.lua` here with the existing `init.lua` found in the config directory.
